      # 1. Edit the path on the LEFT side of the colon (:) to point to your ebook library.
      #    - Replace '/path/to/your/books' with the full, absolute path.
      #    - The ':ro' at the end makes the folder read-only for better security.
      #    - Example for Linux/macOS: /home/user/Books:/ebooks:ro
      #    - Example for Windows: C:/Users/YourUser/Documents/Ebooks:/ebooks:ro
      - /path/to/your/books:/ebooks:ro # <-- EDIT THE PART BEFORE THE COLON

      # 2. This line maps an 'output' folder in the current directory to the container.
      #    A folder named 'output' will be created here with the report.
      #    You can change './output' to an absolute path if you prefer.
      - ./output:/output
