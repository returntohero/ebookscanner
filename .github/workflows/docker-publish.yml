#### **Step 3: Commit and Push**

Commit all your project changes (the new `monitor_and_scan.py`, `Dockerfile`, `requirements.txt`, and the new `.github/workflows/docker-publish.yml` file) and push them to your `main` branch.

```sh
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Implement watchdog monitoring and CI/CD pipeline"
git push origin main
